# MusclePass
MusclePass is a Python-based password strength analyzer that evaluates password security and checks if it has been exposed in data breaches using the Have I Been Pwned (HIBP) API. This GUI application, built with Tkinter, provides real-time feedback and a detailed strength score out of 10 to help users create stronger, more secure passwords.
